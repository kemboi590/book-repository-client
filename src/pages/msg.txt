help me create a bokkstore repository application using react ts. using tailwind css to style.
here is a description of the application: 
Project: Book Repository Application with Full CRUD Functionality
Objective: Develop a Book Repository Application using React that allows users to perform all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on books stored in a local storage array. This application should utilize custom React hooks alongside standard hooks to manage state efficiently and optimize performance, with an emphasis on a clean, user-friendly interface.
Requirements:
Form Input:
Create a form with fields for the book's title, author, and publication year.
Use the useRef hook to manage form inputs for precise control and performance.
State Management:
Utilize the useState hook to maintain the state of the book list.
Implement the useReducer hook to handle actions such as adding, updating, and deleting books from the list, ensuring state transitions are predictable and manageable.
Custom Hook for Local Storage:
Develop a custom hook called useLocalStorage to handle the retrieval, storage, and updating of books. This hook should encapsulate all interactions with local storage, abstracting it away from the component logic.
Use this hook in conjunction with useEffect to load the initial state from local storage and to update it whenever the book list changes.
Pagination and Callbacks:
Display only 5 books at a time in a table format.
Implement pagination to navigate through the list with "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
Use the useCallback hook to wrap the pagination handling function to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
More Features:
Add a search functionality to filter books by title. Use the useEffect hook to listen for changes in the search field and dynamically filter the displayed books.
Enable editing and deleting of book details directly from the table, using the useReducer hook to facilitate state updates for a seamless user experience.
